**Waiting Interval Library**

This library provides a custom implementation for scheduling intervals with increasing delays. It mimics the behavior of setInterval with the added feature of using a configurable array of timeouts, allowing the delay between consecutive executions to change over time.

**Features**

Custom Interval Scheduling: Schedule a callback function with increasing delays.
Flexible Timeout Array: Define an array of timeout durations that dictate the delay pattern.
Robust Error Handling: Throws an error if an empty timeout array is provided.
Memory Cleanup: Automatically cleans up timeout references when intervals are cleared.


**Installation**

Simply copy the source code into your project, or integrate it as a module in your application.

**API Reference**
```
setWaitingInterval
```
**Parameters:**

```handler: (...args: any[]) => void``` – The callback function to be executed.
```timeouts: number[]``` – An array of timeout durations.
```...args: any[] ```– Additional arguments to pass to the callback function.
Returns: A unique interval ID that can be used to clear the interval.

```clearWaitingInterval```

**Parameters:**

```intervalId: number``` – The unique interval ID returned by setWaitingInterval.
Returns: ```void```

**Implementation Details**

The library uses a ```Map``` to store the relationship between custom interval IDs and the actual timeout IDs returned by ```window.setTimeout```.
The delay mechanism is implemented by removing timeout values from the provided array until only one value remains. This ensures that the delay increases in a predictable manner until it stabilizes at the last value.
The code is written in TypeScript with strict type annotations to improve safety and maintainability.
